# Anime Rating Prediction

## Abstrct

The goal of this project is to predict Anime ratings and create a recommendation system for users. In
our midterm project, we learned multiple collaborative filtering techniques from the Netflix Prize
competition. In this project, we applied the techniques like Matrix Factorization or Neighborhood
Models on the Anime dataset on Kaggle. We visualized and cleaned data before implementing 9
different models in Python with Surprise and R with RecommenderLab. The results suggested that
the SVD model gave the lowest RMSE, thus was the most accurate to predict the Anime rating. We
explored the cross validation technique and included an example of our recommender for a user.

The visulization of the results are showned in the presentation, "Math189FinalPresentation.pptx".
